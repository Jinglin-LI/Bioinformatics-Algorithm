# Website for LSM2241 Introductory Bioinformatics in NUS

It shows the work when I work in the area of bioinformatics at the National University of Singapore. 

We build a website for the undergraduate students to learn the principles of bioinformatics concept, understand the procedure of bioinformatics software implementation, such as DNA alignment, Protein alignment, BLAST, and other Genomic applications. 

My work is focus on algorithms such as local and global alignment by implementing the Smith-Waterman and Needleman-Wunsch algorithms, as well as coordinating with teammates.
