# Website for LSM2241 Introductory Bioinformatics in NUS

It shows the work when I work in the area of bioinformatics in Prof. Greg Tucker-Kellogg' s group at the National University of Singapore. 

We build a website for the undergraduate students to learn the principles of bioinformatics concept, understand the procedure of bioinformatics software implementation, such as DBS alignment, Protein alignment, BLAST, and other Genomic applications. 

My work is focus on algorithms such as local and global alignamnet by implementing the Smith-Waterman and Needleman-Wunsch algorithms, as well as cordinating with teammates.
